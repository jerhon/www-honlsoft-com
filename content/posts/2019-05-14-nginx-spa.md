Deploying any single page application requires a web server to host static content. Traditionally, having a web server requires configuring a server somewhere to run the software to host the application.

I have been using docker for approximately two years, and it's become one of my favorite tools to deploy applications.  The main benefit is the simplicity of configuring and using different software components.  Using a new technology is easy as it get's compartmentalized with all it's dependencies together.  It lessens the load to install and configure servers on both developers and IT.

This means, rather than configuring a web server on a specific Linux VM.  I set up a container with a web server that can be deployed to any server.  This eliminates the need for lengthy software installs, and provides a lot of other benefits around security.

One of these technologies I'll use on docker for an HTTP webserver is [nginx](www.nginx.com).  It has a large community and is pretty lightweight.  The main detriment is it's configuration.  The configuration files and modules can be daunting at times-- even for simple tasks such as this.  

There are several considerations to take into account, and things I've had to learn the hard way.  Here are some things I've had to take into consideration.

## Don't cache the index page

If an application is frequently updated, and the browser caches the main index page, the updates won't occur.  Users may end up seeing cached versions of the pages which are older versions of the application. 

I will direct the browser not to cache the index page, and let the browsers use the If-Modified-Since HTTP header to avoid having to transfer the full page, unless the page has changed.  I feel like this gives me a good balance between network traffic and maintainability.

This also relies on tools such as webpack generate new hashes on their javascript / HTML bundles which will change when there are new builds.  In other words-- the index changes when they produce a new build.  If this is not the case, then you shouldn't cache any of the application.

## SSL

Servers directly reachable from the network should be set up for SSL.  I don't have this in my nginx example, but it's one of the easier things to configure.

Using Let's Encrypt is the easiest way to secure your domain and site.

## Reverse proxy APIs

If the application has an API it uses, and the API is hosted internally, sometimes it makes sense to have a reverse proxy built into the web server to avoid cross origin issues.  This allows API request to be in the same URL structure as the application.

This does raise some extra concerns such as timeouts, added latency of an additional network hop, etc.  

## Sample configuration 

Here's a sample nginx configuration that I use as a boilerplate for my projects.
