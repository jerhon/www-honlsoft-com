I'm a software engineer and architect with over 12 years of experience.  I enjoy building software, and the challenges that arrise from building it.

I'm currently a Lead Developer at Border States Electric.  There I have been involved in development for a wide range of projects ranging from integrations, to mobile development, to web development.  This has been in a variety of different technology stacks such as .NET Core, Java, Spring Framework, AngularJS / Angular, Apache Cordova.  All this in just the first year on the Job!

I've worked in a variety of different technologies, and am always open to learning more.

# How I Started Coding

I started writing software in middle school and started out learning basic.  My first experience with code was with a book a cryptography and making your own secret codes.  There was a BASIC program in the back of the book, and I asked my dad to convert it to Visual Basic.  I remember reading through the code trying to decipher what it meant.

From there, I started learning how to code.  I started learning Visual Basic, and QBasic.  Eventually, I moved on to C++ / C.  Perhaps my favorite accomplishment in high school was writing a bootloader and putting it on a floppy disk and programming various hardware to do things.

After high school, I went to college for computer science.  Most of the coursework was in Java, but I got to work in various other languages as well.  I was able to do an internship with IBM for approximately a year and a half while I was going to school, which was my first time programming professionally.
