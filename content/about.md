I'm a software engineer and architect with over 12 years of professional software development experience and 20 years of programming experience.  I enjoy building software, and the challenges that rise from building it.

I'm currently Software Architect at Border States Electric.  There I have been involved in development for a wide range of projects ranging from integrations, mobile application, and web development.  This has been in a variety of different technology stacks such as .NET Core, Java, Spring Framework, AngularJS / Angular, Apache Cordova.  All this in just the first year on the Job!

Previously, I worked for several years at Networked Energy Services.  I built server software to interact and manage a smart electricity grid.  This involved building highly scalable software that was able to communicate with hundreds of thousands of remote devices over a cellular network.  I worked on all facets of the software from API design, to low level communication such as integrating TLS libraries for security, testing tools development, build tools and processes, and many others.  I slowly progressed to eventually being a software architect prior to leaving.

# How I Started

I started writing software in middle school and started out learning BASIC.  My first experience with code was with a book on cryptography for kids and making your own secret codes.  There was a BASIC program in the back of the book, and I asked my dad to convert it to Visual Basic.  I remember reading through the code trying to decipher what it meant.

After I that first program, I slowly learned how to code.  I started learning Visual Basic, and QBasic.  Eventually, I moved on to C++ / C.  Perhaps my favorite accomplishment in high school was writing a boot loader, and putting it on a floppy disk and programming various hardware to do things.

After high school, I went to college for computer science.  Most of the coursework was in Java, but I worked in various other languages as well.  I was able to do an internship with IBM for approximately a year and a half while I was going to school, which was my first time programming professionally.
